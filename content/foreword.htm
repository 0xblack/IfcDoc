              buildingSMART develops open standards for Building Information
              Modeling, openBIM. The standards deal with data models, processes
              and terms. The <em>Industry Foundation Classes</em> IFC
              specification constitutes buildingSMART's specification for the
              buildingSMART data model. Property terms, defined in IFC, are
			  linked to terms defined in the buildingSMART data dictionary (IFD).

            <p class="std">
              buildingSMART liaises with the International Standardization
              Organization ISO, regional and national standardization bodies
              for developing international, regional and national standards.
              The <em>Industry Foundation Classes</em> IFC specification is
              registered as ISO 16739 and, in its current form IFC4 RC3, it is
              submitted as a separate documentation format to be accepted as an
              ISO Draft International Standard DIS. Submission is made to the
              Technical Committee ISO TC184/SC4, <em>Industrial automation
              systems and integration</em>, Subcommittee SC4 <em>Industrial
              data</em>.
